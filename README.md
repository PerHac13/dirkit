## Features (Planned for Initial Release)

- Generate a directory tree for any given folder.
- Export directory structures to JSON format.
- Control the depth of the generated directory tree.
- Simple and straightforward CLI interface.

## Installation

Currently, `DirKit` is under development and not yet published to npm. Once published, you can install it globally using:

```

## Usage

After installing, you can use the `dirkit` command as follows:

```bash
npx dirkit generate <dir-path>
```

- Replace `<dir-path>` with the path of the directory you want to generate the tree for.
